It's Friday and time for me to be driving home for Christmas! Off to spend it with my family. I hope you'll all have a wonderful festive period.

Let's get to it and leave work early!

### **🤌 Ben's Picks**

We ran a hackathon and here are the winners!

🏆 1st Place: **Brancher.ai - Connect AI models to build powerful apps - without code**. It was so impressive to see how much this team of 2 accomplished in one week. ([link](https://www.brancher.ai/))

🥉 3rd Place: **EcoSnap - Recycle your plastic better with Artificial Intelligence.** ([link](https://ecosnap.vercel.app/))

🤗 Best in Open-Source (Hugging Face prize): **EcoSnap - Recycle your plastic better with Artificial Intelligence.** ([link](https://ecosnap.vercel.app/))

We have 75 submissions total and our judging panel gave scores based on originality, quality, impressiveness and real-world use-case. We'll chat to the winners and get a bit more of a background story to bring to you in the New Year.

Congratulations to all our winners and we'll be doing another hackathon soon! I'll announce the honourable mentions next week.
