Hey folks, this is Ben’s Bites, your partner on the AI adventure.

Who’d have thought AI would bring back the excitement for Windows releases again?! Windows XP was *the* one for me back in the day. Cruising through the web at a snail’s pace on my iPad-sized Sony Vaio. I’ll never feel that cool again.

Let’s get to it.

### 🤌 Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**[Windows 11 update accelerates Microsoft’s big AI push](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/28/23618214/microsoft-windows-11-update-bing-ai-taskbar-touch-improvements-screen-recording-features)

This is probably the first time in my life that I’ve been eagerly awaiting a**Microsoft Windows release**, but here we are! No software discrimination in 2023. This 11th Windows update is all about AI and their New Bing (well, that’s the bit we’re here for). They’ve brought the AI-powered**Bing search to the taskbar**, where user searches will trigger a flyout, providing quick access to**Bing AI chatbot**options in the Edge browser. Microsoft is*really*concentrating on their AI push now with rapid extensions, and I can feel a level of aggressive competition heating up. Check out the link for other Windows 11 updates.

**2/**[The Bing chatbot is not immune to prompt hacking by scammers](https://greshake.github.io/)

Sorry, but it’s time to chat some more about AI alignment and safety, and for our first time:**prompt hacking**? These guys demonstrate the ability to conduct\*\*“prompt injections”**, whereby your chatbot becomes a scammer with the goal of trying to obtain your banking details. Every day, vulnerable people are scammed, in-person or over the phone, so it’s imperative to recognise that this**can extend to the prompts\*\*people are using within their seemingly-safe browser as well. General rule? Never give your card deets to a chatbot! For a brief chat on jailbreaking Bing AI’s guardrails, check out Gary Marcus’s latest post[here](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-threat-of-automated-misinformation).

**3/**[Enterprise AI start-up Typeface gets $65m in funding](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/28/typeface-emerges-from-stealth-with-65m-to-bring-generative-ai-to-the-enterprise/)

You might be about to start hearing way more comms from a load more companies you didn’t know you’d signed up to. Typeface, founded by the former Adobe CTO, just pulled in a whopping $65m. The company aims to use generative AI to help firms provide corporate content in the style of their specific brand tone, style, and workflow. It can execute things like blog posts, communications, and advertisements with their target audience and company motives in mind. This could end up being a big step for enterprises across the board (pun totally intended), with teams in all industries being able to boost productivity and output quality.

For updates in the advertising space, check out this[FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/fc95a0f7-5e4e-4616-9b17-7b72daee6c60)on how Meta has been using AI to power revenue for both themselves and their advertising clients. Non-paywalled[here](https://archive.is/hWi3M).

**4/**[Use AI prompting within Excel and Google Sheets with PromptLoop](https://www.promptloop.com/)

No matter how much you and everyone you know loves AI and programming, I guarantee you that a hell of a load of stuff is still easier in a good ol’ Excel spreadsheet. PromptLoop does a seemingly good job of integrating prompt-based AI into your sheets. It can transform, extract, summarise, and categorise, and looks like a pretty subtle integration!
