Hey folks, today we’ve Amazon working on AI in its search bar, Quora Poe’s API, Cloudfare’s new AI tools, and the big gun Open AI thinking of launching an open source AI.

Let’s get to it.

[Amazon might be using generative AI to shape product search](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-15/amazon-plans-to-add-chatgpt-style-search-to-its-online-store?srnd=technology-vp\&leadSource=uverify%20wall)

Whilst everyone’s been getting in a tizzy over the future of search, we’ve all forgotten about that**other search bar**that we use a heck of a lot… The**Amazon** **one**! In fact, over half of US shoppers say that Amazon is their first stop for product search over Google. But**let’s be honest, it’s bad.**

Now job postings at Amazon suggest that they’re looking for senior devs to “reimagine Search with an interactive conversational experience” to create a**transformation in product search**. With significant investments in generative AI, Amazon might be the first large-scale product platform to have generative AI embedded within it. And hopefully, improve the search experience.

[Open-source firm Together land $20m to make AI and Cloud accessible](https://www.together.xyz/blog/seed-funding?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=amazon-search-bar-under-ai-repairs)

There’s been a lot of chit chat recently around how Big Tech genuinely might struggle to compete with the power of**open-source development**of AI. And when investors are sticking as much as\*\*$20m**behind it, you can’t help but wonder… Open-source firm**Together**just landed a seed investment of that size, with the plan to continue building AI models and an**AI-specialised cloud platform\*\*. The cloud platform has been built to efficiently scale training and inference, and is gonna be open in the coming months! That’s big open-source news.

[Quora’s Poe chatbot now comes with an API for developers](https://twitter.com/adamdangelo/status/1658121701077516291)

**Quora’s**cutely-named**Poe**chat has been gaining a decent amount of popularity over the past few months, with the ability to chat to various different bot providers in a single app. Now, they’re releasing the**Poe API**so that developers of LLM-based apps can get truly stuck into building chatbots. Users of OpenAI and Anthropic, creators of in-house LLMs, and any other use-cases will be possible using the API. And it even includes integrations with LangChain!

[Open-Source AI Is Gaining on Google and ChatGPT](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/open-source-ai-is-gaining-on-google-and-chatgpt?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=amazon-search-bar-under-ai-repairs)

Yesterday, I included an article saying that Open Source AI is flourishing because of Big Tech’s models being released publicly. Here’s another viewpoint on the same: Some companies will release open source models (like Meta is doing now) and then**others will have to follow suit anyway**(like Open AI might do, according to this article).

Companies like Meta and Google stand to gain from releasing its models, as developers will improve them, and they can add those improvements in their in-house apps. But for OpenAI, its $27 billion private**valuation depends on their proprietary model**being used for commercial purposes, not open-source software.
